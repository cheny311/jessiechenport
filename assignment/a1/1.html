Ada's description:
A three-layer copper green fountain, always spraying water. it set above a smooth aqua basin in the park.

When I imagine a fountain, I think of a cool summer day—breeze in the trees and warm sunlight. So I chose a light, youthful palette (mint, cyan, aqua, with soft pinks) to create a relaxed, refreshing mood through color and shape.

I combined ellipses, rectangles, and curveVertex to build the stacked basins and water surfaces; rectangles connect the tiers, and ellipses + rectangles decorate the top.
I adapted an online “radial gradient” idea and wrote a radialGradient(x, y, w, h, cInner, cOuter, steps) helper that stacks concentric ellipses to get a soft water look.

I used beginShape with bezierVertex to simulate the water lifting slightly and then curving down; I adjusted scale and position to reach a satisfying composition.


in the process of making the fountain, I noticed that in the beginning I was imagining moving elements and more presice shape for everything. but eventually, i learned how to change from the thing that I was trap in and turn them into some sort of design.
I first imagined moving elements and very precise shapes. When some effects didn’t work as I hoped, I accepted the limitations and iterated from there.
I’m not fully comfortable with curveVertex() and bezierVertex when encourter with lots of vertex they can feel confusing. I realized many repeated shapes could be refactored into functions, which would save time.
