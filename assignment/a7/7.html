        <div class="scroll-box">A playful p5.js mini-journey about dating as performance, timing, and luck — ending in a wedding photo booth you can actually save.

Swipe, hold hands, kiss at the right moment, then build your own over-the-top wedding photo as a souvenir.

# How to Play

Follow what the scene tells you to do.

Press 1 anytime to quickly jump to the next scene (debug / fast travel).

# Scenes (Player Guide)

Scene 0 — Enter the world

A short intro/splash scene that sets the tone.

Scene 1 — Warm-up / animation

A transition scene to move you forward into the “dating app logic.”

Scene 2 — Getting closer

You’re learning the rhythm of interaction — how closeness is negotiated.

Scene 3 — Timing test (kiss)

Kissing is about timing. Click at the right moment to “pass.”

If you succeed, you get the Sunday date.

If you fail, you’re dumped and pushed back into the loop.

Scene 4 — Wedding Photo Booth (the reward)

Upload an image or use your webcam, then place yourself into a dramatic wedding template.
Save the final canvas as your “relationship proof.”

# more to read

My inspiration came from my experiences using dating apps in New York City. I often feel that people are constantly trying to make themselves more attractive by adjusting or reshaping who they are. Communication in these spaces can feel performative, filled with gestures, timing, and impressions rather than genuine understanding. This project reflects that pressure, as well as the uncertainty, fantasy, and emotional distance that often come with dating.

In the first scene, I created a game based on the fundamentals of a color-matching system. Players are asked to match a target color by adjusting RGB values, where each channel represents a different personal quality. The act of “tuning” these values mirrors how people selectively present parts of themselves in order to appear compatible. Once the player completes this task, they are allowed to enter the dating game.

When interacting with others in the dating scene, there is only a 10% chance that the player will “get along” with another person and result in a “hang out.” Otherwise, the player will be unmatched. This outcome is not meant to feel personal—it is purely based on chance, reflecting the randomness of dating apps. Often, rejection happens before either person has the opportunity to truly know the other, reinforcing how quickly assumptions are made.

After that, the player enters a movie-like scene where the task is to hold hands. If the player moves too fast, the other hand pulls away; if the player moves too slowly or keeps too much distance, the other hand reaches forward. This interaction represents the ambiguity of emotional distance when getting to know someone new, and the constant negotiation of closeness and restraint.

Once the hands are held, the player moves on to a kissing interaction. Here, everything is about timing—you must click at the right moment for the kiss to be successful. This moment emphasizes how intimacy can feel less about intention and more about performing the “right” action at the “right” time. If the kiss is approved, the relationship progresses, and the player is invited to meet the other person on Sunday and begin planning a wedding photo together. If the player fails and becomes a “bad kisser,” they are rejected and must start over.

In the wedding scene, players can either upload an image or use their webcam to complete a wedding photo. They can adjust the width and height of the image and save the final result. I designed multiple wedding photo templates inspired by wedding photography that I see as a form of subcultural expression. These images are exaggerated, stylized, and emotionally charged, revealing how marriage can function as a performance and fantasy rather than a purely traditional ideal. Instead of using strangers’ faces, I replaced them with my own, inserting myself into these imagined futures.

This scene reflects my tendency to develop emotional attachments quickly, sometimes before the timing is right. While these imagined futures can feel intense and convincing, they may also be built on partial understanding or projection. After completing the wedding photo, the player can choose to stop there—or take the train home, where people begin swiping on dating apps once again, returning to the cycle.
