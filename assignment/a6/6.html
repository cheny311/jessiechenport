          <p>This is a data portrait that visualizes personal data through an animated character.</p>
          <p>The character features:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Red hair with individual strands</li>
            <li>Animated mouth that displays data as a wave form</li>
            <li>Interactive arms that follow your mouse movement</li>
            <li>Data values: [90, 67, 90, 55, 82, 100, 80]</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           For this data portrait, I used my mood as data and turned it into the shape of the mouth on my character.
The mouth moves like a heartbeat, showing how emotions can rise and fall in small waves.
I built this piece based on one of my previous characters, using her as a base for this visual expression.
While making it, I realized it helps me to keep an eye on my own mood — not to control it, but just to notice it.


Through tracking my mood, I learned that feelings shift quietly all the time — sometimes without me even realizing it.
Turning those emotions into data made me more aware of them, but also made them feel a little less personal, almost mechanical.
Something was gained — I could see myself more clearly, from a small distance.
But something was also lost — the warmth and texture of how emotions actually feel in the moment.

Still, I like how the mouth keeps moving, as if it’s breathing.
It reminds me that data can’t capture everything, but it can still hold traces of how I was feeling — and that’s enough.
