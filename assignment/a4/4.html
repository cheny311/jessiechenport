          <p>In this assignment, we each created a sketch and later combined parts from other people’s work to build a new creature. I really enjoyed the process of making and experimenting with forms, though at the same time I felt that my creature might not fully reflect the original sketches of others, since I naturally leaned into my own personal interests and aesthetic approach. This made me think about how collaboration always involves a balance between respecting others’ input and expressing one’s own style.

On the technical side, I tried to use different functions to simplify my code. However, when I drew the bangs, I realized I was still “hard coding” each element instead of writing a for-loop to generate them horizontally. This showed me the limitations of my current method and made me think about how to integrate more computational logic into my drawing in future projects.</p>
